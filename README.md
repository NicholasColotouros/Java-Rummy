Java-Rummy
==========

A java implementation of the card game Gin-Rummy as part of an optional, ungraded project for COMP 303.
The rules that will be used for this implementation of the game can be found [here](http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html).

The project compiles but suffers from runtime exception errors. Since the project was not graded it served as an experiment in program structure and with the swing UI. You can open any of the diagrams in the diagrams folder using violet UML, which can be found in the tools folder. 

##General Setup (for working on the project)

1. Install git and clone the repository. [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) is a nice tool to use.
2. Clone the repository either through command line or clicking "Clone to Desktop" on the right if you have github for Windows
3. Now you'll have a Java-Rummy folder. Create your eclipse workspace one level above (myworkspace\Java-Rummy) and import the project.


##Milestone 1 Setup

1. Install [the Eclipse Checkstyle plugin](http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/downloads.html).
2. Install [EclEmma plugin](http://eclemma.com/).
3. Make sure Checkstyle is using the /style/Style.xml file from the imported project.
4. To make your life easier, you can also import the code formatter found in /style
