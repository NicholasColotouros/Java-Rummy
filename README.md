Java-Rummy
==========

A java implementation of the card game Gin-Rummy as part of an optional, ungraded project for COMP 303.
The rules that will be used for this implementation of the game can be found [here](http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html).

The project compiles but suffers from runtime exception errors. Since the project was not graded it served as an experiment in program structure and with the swing UI. You can open any of the diagrams in the diagrams folder using violet UML, which can be found in the tools folder.
